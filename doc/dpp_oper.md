- Addition.
```pawn
console.cout(1+1);
```

2
```

### Operator: `-`
- Subtraction.
```pawn
console.cout(1-1);
```

Output:

```

```

### Operator: `*`
- Multiplication.
```pawn
console.cout(1*1);
```

Output:

```

```

### Operator: `/`
- Division.
```pawn
console.cout(4/2);
```

Output:

```

```

### Operator: `^`
- Exponentiation.
```pawn

```

Output:

Little example:

```pawn
if.equ,5/5,1+0->console.println,"Math test passed!";
```

You may also use constants, variables and user forms as an Operator arguments:

```pawn
new.int,MATHVAR=1+1;
console.cout(MATHVAR);

new.int,MATHVAR22=6+MATHVAR;
console.cout(MATHVAR22);
```

Output:

```
2
